# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM Translation feature enhances the VideoSpeak system by integrating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for translation, providing an alternative to the existing Sarvam API. This feature will allow users to leverage state-of-the-art language models for high-quality translations of transcribed video content, with support for a wide range of languages and improved contextual understanding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have the option to use LLM-based translation instead of the default Sarvam API, so that I can get potentially higher quality translations for my video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a video for processing THEN the system SHALL provide an option to select between Sarvam API and LLM for translation
2. WHEN LLM translation is selected THEN the system SHALL use the configured LLM service for translation instead of Sarvam API
3. WHEN no translation method is explicitly selected THEN the system SHALL default to the previously configured translation service
4. IF the selected LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to Sarvam API and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM translation to support all languages that the VideoSpeak system currently supports, so that I don't lose language coverage when switching translation methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM translation is enabled THEN the system SHALL support all Indian languages currently supported by the Sarvam API
2. WHEN displaying language options THEN the system SHALL indicate which languages are supported by which translation method
3. WHEN a language is selected that is not supported by the chosen translation method THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest alternatives
4. WHEN new languages become available THEN the system SHALL update the language options without requiring code changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM translation to provide high-quality, contextually accurate translations, so that I get better results than with traditional translation APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translating with LLM THEN the system SHALL preserve the context and meaning of the original text
2. WHEN translating technical or domain-specific content THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate terminology
3. WHEN translating long content THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency throughout the translation
4. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide quality metrics specific to LLM translation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to configure different LLM providers and models, so that I can optimize for cost, performance, or quality based on needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to configure multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN configuring LLM providers THEN the system SHALL support API key management and endpoint configuration
3. WHEN a specific model is selected THEN the system SHALL optimize prompts and parameters for that model
4. WHEN translation requests are made THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and quotas for the selected LLM provider

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM translation to handle specialized content like technical terms, idioms, and cultural references appropriately, so that translations are more natural and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translating content with technical terminology THEN the system SHALL preserve technical accuracy
2. WHEN translating content with cultural references or idioms THEN the system SHALL provide culturally appropriate translations
3. WHEN domain-specific jargon is detected THEN the system SHALL maintain the specialized vocabulary in the target language
4. WHEN translating content with ambiguous meanings THEN the system SHALL use context to determine the most appropriate translation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors and limitations of LLM translation gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM translation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with potential solutions
2. WHEN content exceeds LLM token limits THEN the system SHALL chunk the content appropriately and maintain consistency
3. WHEN LLM translation is slow or unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and estimated completion times
4. WHEN inappropriate content is detected THEN the system SHALL handle it according to content policies and inform the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see accuracy and confidence metrics for LLM translations, so that I can assess the quality and reliability of the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM translation is complete THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores for the translation
2. WHEN displaying translation results THEN the system SHALL highlight any portions with low confidence
3. WHEN accuracy is below a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential quality issues
4. WHEN comparing translation methods THEN the system SHALL provide metrics to help users choose between Sarvam API and LLM translation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM translation to be cost-effective and efficient, so that I can translate content without excessive costs or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing translation requests THEN the system SHALL optimize token usage to minimize costs
2. WHEN translating short videos THEN the system SHALL complete LLM translation within a reasonable time frame
3. WHEN multiple translation requests are queued THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently based on priority and resource availability
4. WHEN translation is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates and allow cancellation if costs exceed user-defined thresholds
